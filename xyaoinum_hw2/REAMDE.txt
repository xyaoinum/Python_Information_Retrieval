FUNCTIONALITY OF EACH PROGRAM & HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAMS:
	There are 7 files in this folder (xyaoinum_hw2):
	1. Q1.py
	-- program for question 1. Run the program, and in the terminal you will be prompted to give a query,
	then, you will be prompted to enter the mode, "1" for TF/IDF, and "2" for normalized TF/IDF.
	Then the program will calculat the corresponding weight, it takes about 5 seconds, and the result
	will be shown on the terminal.

	2. Q2.py
	-- program for question 2. Run the program, and the result is shown in the terminal.It takes about
	10 seconds.

	3. Q3.py
	-- program for question 3. Run the program, and the result will be shown in the terminal.
	This may take 10-30 minutes because the program needs to access every webpages.

	4. stemmer.py
	-- This python program gives a implementation of the Porter stemmer method which
        was downloaded from the link in the course website.

	5. helper.py
	-- this contains some helper functions that I use in Q1, Q2 and Q3.

	6. umichUrlList
	-- This file contains 1500 urls from the first assignment.

	7. README
	-- this file

 Besides, in order that the program runs correctly, the tester need to
 un-zip and copy the folder "cranfieldDocs" into this folder (xyaoinum_hw2).



ANSWERS TO Q2 AND Q3:

Q2:
TF/IDF without normalization
top 10 doc, precision, recall:  0.174222222222 0.24317617866
top 50 doc, precision, recall:  0.0615111111111 0.429280397022
top 100 doc, precision, recall:  0.0372 0.519230769231
top 500 doc, precision, recall:  0.00959111111111 0.66935483871

TF/IDF with normalization
top 10 doc, precision, recall:  0.173333333333 0.241935483871
top 50 doc, precision, recall:  0.0623111111111 0.434863523573
top 100 doc, precision, recall:  0.0375555555556 0.524193548387
top 500 doc, precision, recall:  0.00961777777778 0.671215880893

Roughly, the TF/IDF with normalization gives slightly better result.
Normalization is better because document may vary in length, and longer document
will inherently have higher 'tf' without normalization, but this can be misleading.
A word appearing 10 times in a document with 100 words is more important than a word
appearing 15 times in a book with 1000000 words. So what's important is the relative
frequency instead of the absolute frequency.
